# Agent PR Loop — design -> todo -> implement -> (review <-> fix)* -> (optional) PR
#
# Readability goals:
# - LLM steps use `worker: OPENCODE | CLAUDE_CODE` directly.
# - Small orchestration lives in scripts.
#
# Run on another workspace (any git repo directory):
#   AGENTCORE_ROOT=/path/to/agentcore
#   TARGET=/path/to/your/repo
#   AGENTCORE_ROOT="$AGENTCORE_ROOT" bun run --cwd "$AGENTCORE_ROOT" ./src/workflow/run.ts \
#     "$AGENTCORE_ROOT/examples/agent-pr-loop.yaml" --workspace "$TARGET" --supervised --verbose

      You are OpenCode.

      Task: Produce a design doc ONLY (no implementation).

      Read:
      - .agentcore-loop/request.md

      Write/update:
      - .agentcore-loop/design.md

      Design doc requirements:
      - Problem statement + goals/non-goals
      - Proposed approach + alternatives considered
      - Data model / interfaces (as needed)
      - Execution plan at high level
      - Risks/edge cases + observability/testing notes
      - Explicit acceptance criteria checklist

    worker: OPENCODE
    model: "openai/gpt-5.2"
    depends_on: [design]
    instructions: |
      You are OpenCode.

      Task: Convert the design into a concrete TODO checklist.

      Read:
      - .agentcore-loop/request.md
      - .agentcore-loop/design.md

      Write/update:
      - .agentcore-loop/todo.md

      TODO requirements:
      - Use Markdown checklist items: "- [ ] ..."
      - Group tasks by milestones (small batches)
      - Include file paths when possible
      - Include at least 1 testing task (how to run + expected outcome)
      - Include at least 1 validation step (manual or automated)
      - Include rollback/escape hatch notes if risky

      If .agentcore-loop/todo.md already exists, improve it to satisfy the requirements.

    description: "Implement by Claude Code; review by OpenCode; repeat until PASS"
    worker: CLAUDE_CODE
    model: "claude-opus-4-6"
    depends_on: [todo]
    instructions: |
      You are Claude Code.

      Use Claude's team feature if available (split into implement/test/review roles internally).

      Read:
      - .agentcore-loop/request.md
      - .agentcore-loop/design.md
      - .agentcore-loop/todo.md
      - .agentcore-loop/review.md (if present)
      - .agentcore-loop/fix.md (if present)

      Task:
      - If .agentcore-loop/fix.md exists and is non-empty, apply ONLY those fixes (minimal, targeted changes).
      - Otherwise, implement the TODO checklist.
      - Update the TODO checkboxes as you complete items.
      - Run the repo's tests (or the best available test command) and fix failures.
      - Keep changes focused on the request.

      At the end, briefly report what was implemented and how to verify.

      decision_file: ".agentcore-loop/review.verdict"
      instructions: |
        You are OpenCode.

        Task:
        - Review the work against the request.
        - Write/update:
          - .agentcore-loop/review.md
          - .agentcore-loop/review.verdict (structured JSON; see Output rules)
        - If verdict is FAIL, also write/update:
          - .agentcore-loop/fix.md (non-empty; concrete, actionable steps; include file paths)
        - If verdict is PASS:
          - Clear .agentcore-loop/fix.md if it exists (truncate to empty) so stale FAIL instructions cannot leak into future runs.

        Before reviewing, generate these review inputs (workspace is a git repo):
        - bash "${AGENTCORE_ROOT:-.}/scripts/agent-pr-loop/review-inputs.sh"

        You must read at least:
        - .agentcore-loop/request.md
        - .agentcore-loop/design.md (if present)
        - .agentcore-loop/todo.md (if present)
        - .agentcore-loop/review.base_ref
        - .agentcore-loop/review.diff
        - .agentcore-loop/review.status
        - .agentcore-loop/review.untracked
        - .agentcore-loop/review.untracked.diff

        Format for .agentcore-loop/review.md:
        - Sections: Summary, Strengths, Issues, Verification

        Output rules:
        - Write .agentcore-loop/review.verdict as a single-line JSON object:
          - PASS => {"decision":"complete","check_id":"$AGENTCORE_COMPLETION_CHECK_ID"}
          - FAIL => {"decision":"incomplete","check_id":"$AGENTCORE_COMPLETION_CHECK_ID"}
        - When FAIL, also include:
          - "reasons": ["..."]        (human-readable, short)
          - "fingerprints": ["..."]   (stable IDs; used by the Convergence Controller)
        - Fingerprint rules:
          - Stable across iterations for the *same* underlying issue.
          - Prefer file/line/test identifiers (e.g. "test:pkg/foo TestBar", "lint:src/x.ts:42", "scope:charts/...").
          - Keep each item short.
        - Fallback: if you cannot emit JSON, write legacy text "PASS" or "FAIL" only (no extra words).
        - If verdict is PASS, clear .agentcore-loop/fix.md if it exists (truncate to empty).
