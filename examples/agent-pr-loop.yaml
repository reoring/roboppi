# Agent PR Loop — design -> todo -> implement -> (review <-> fix)* -> (optional) PR
#
# Readability goals:
# - LLM steps use `worker: OPENCODE | CLAUDE_CODE | CODEX_CLI` directly.
# - Small orchestration lives in scripts.
#
# Run on another workspace (any git repo directory):
#   AGENTCORE_ROOT=/path/to/agentcore
#   TARGET=/path/to/your/repo
#   AGENTCORE_ROOT="$AGENTCORE_ROOT" bun run --cwd "$AGENTCORE_ROOT" ./src/workflow/run.ts \
#     "$AGENTCORE_ROOT/examples/agent-pr-loop.yaml" --workspace "$TARGET" --verbose

      You are OpenCode.

      Task: Produce a design doc ONLY (no implementation).

      Read:
      - .agentcore-loop/request.md

      Write/update:
      - .agentcore-loop/design.md

      Design doc requirements:
      - Problem statement + goals/non-goals
      - Proposed approach + alternatives considered
      - Data model / interfaces (as needed)
      - Execution plan at high level
      - Risks/edge cases + observability/testing notes
      - Explicit acceptance criteria checklist

    worker: OPENCODE
    model: "openai/gpt-5.2"
    depends_on: [design]
    instructions: |
      You are OpenCode.

      Task: Convert the design into a concrete TODO checklist.

      Read:
      - .agentcore-loop/request.md
      - .agentcore-loop/design.md

      Write/update:
      - .agentcore-loop/todo.md

      TODO requirements:
      - Use Markdown checklist items: "- [ ] ..."
      - Group tasks by milestones (small batches)
      - Include file paths when possible
      - Include at least 1 testing task (how to run + expected outcome)
      - Include at least 1 validation step (manual or automated)
      - Include rollback/escape hatch notes if risky

      If .agentcore-loop/todo.md already exists, improve it to satisfy the requirements.

    instructions: |
      You are Claude Code.

      Use Claude's team feature if available (split into implement/test/review roles internally).

      Read:
      - .agentcore-loop/request.md
      - .agentcore-loop/design.md
      - .agentcore-loop/todo.md

      Task:
      - Implement the TODO checklist.
      - Update the TODO checkboxes as you complete items.
      - Run the repo's tests (or the best available test command) and fix failures.
      - Keep changes focused on the request.

      At the end, briefly report what was implemented and how to verify.
